# A simple disk benchmarking utility for linux\
This is a simple disk benchmarking project that utilizes the /dev/zero and /dev/random files in the linux system to\
create a simple benchmarking tool for whichever drive this program is asked to perform the test on.\
\
If someone decides to work with this, kindly verify the code before executing. \
I am not a professional and can man mistakes.\
